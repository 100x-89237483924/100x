## Can you listen as Dolphins do? 

* The Ideal Candidate will document word-for-word as they listen in meetings.  At Slower, we call this “Dolphin”–code for Extraordinary Listening. Listening to understand first, thinking critically to assess all the options and then replying with exceptional solutions for clients that are extremely customer obsessed, i.e empathetic.. Are you up for the challenge?

## Building a Team Together
